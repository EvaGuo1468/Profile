### Selected Project
#### Predictive Modeling for Bike-Sharing Usage
**Code:** [LINK](https://github.com/ezhongguo/Bike-Sharing-Usage/blob/main/Predictive%20Modeling%20for%20Bike-Sharing%20Usage.ipynb)
* **Description:**
The project focuses on building predictive models to forecast pick-up and drop-off counts at bike-sharing stations. Utilizing historical data on weather conditions and bike-sharing usage, linear regression models were developed to provide insights into the optimal allocation of bikes and docks at specific stations.
* **Role:** Responsible for data preprocessing, feature selection, model development, and evaluation.
* **Team Size:** 4
* **Skills:**
  * Data Analysis and Preprocessing
  * Statistical Modeling and Machine Learning
  * Python Programming (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
  * Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
  * Linear Regression and Model Evaluation Metrics

#### Statistical Models for Economic Growth Rate Analysis
**Code:** [LINK](https://github.com/ezhongguo/Economic-Growth-Rate/blob/main/Economic%20Growth%20Rate%20Analysis.ipynb)
* **Description:**
This project aims to investigate the relationship between economic indicators and GDP growth rate. We analyze various factors such as inflation rate, unemployment rate, real interest rate, primary school enrollment rate, and their impact on GDP growth. Using multivariate linear regression models, we aim to identify the most influential factors affecting economic growth across different time periods and countries. 
* **Role:** Responsible for data cleaning, preprocessing, and statistical analysis.
* **Team Size:** 4
* **Skills:**
  * Data Wrangling
    Pandas: Data manipulation, reading Excel, and renaming columns.
  * Linear Regression
    Statsmodels: Statistical modeling and linear regression.
    Sklearn: Data splitting with train_test_split.
  * Data Visualization
    Matplotlib: Basic plots, like scatter plots for GDP growth.
    Seaborn: Enhanced visual scatter plots.

### MyStanCodeProjects

#### Baby names
* **DEMO Video:** [LINK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EREk00LTtlER3VqBbw1kDceA5bLc0Afo/view?usp=sharing)
* **Code:** [LINK](https://github.com/ezhongguo/MyStanCodeProjects/tree/main/Babynames)
* **Description:**
This project is focused on analyzing and visualizing baby names data across various years. The program reads data from text files containing baby names ranked by popularity for each year and provides functionalities to add new data, search for names, and visualize the historical trends of selected names. 
* **Skills:**
Implemented a dictionary-based data structure for baby names, handled file operations, developed data manipulation functions, implemented a search feature, collaborated on GUI development using tkinter, visualized data with line charts, and managed error handling.

#### Word Search - boggle
* **DEMO Video:** [LINK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NqmXw-dwOFOjexf9Rz80wokwZ_Mkh8c1/view?usp=sharing)
* **Code:** [LINK](https://github.com/ezhongguo/MyStanCodeProjects/blob/main/Boggle/boggle.py)
* **Description:**
The Boggle project is a program that finds words on a 4x4 grid of letters. Users input the grid, and the program searches for valid words based on a dictionary file.
* **Skills:**
Implemented file handling for dictionary reading, validated user input, utilized recursion for word finding, managed grid representation with dictionaries, manipulated strings for word construction, measured execution time, optimized search with prefix checking, and utilized sets to manage word storage.

#### Word Search - Anagram
* **DEMO Video:** [LINK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dutHTsvSueqjCnCZzLJgej_FdrwrSrlq/view?usp=sharing)
* **Code:** [LINK](https://github.com/ezhongguo/MyStanCodeProjects/blob/main/Anagram/anagram.py)
* **Description:**
The Anagram project finds all anagrams for a user-input word using recursive permutation generation and dictionary validation.
* **Skills:**
Implemented file handling to read an English dictionary, used recursion for permutation generation to find anagrams, managed data with lists and pairs, measured execution time, and optimized permutation generation with prefix checking.

#### Web Crawler
* **Code:** [LINK](https://github.com/ezhongguo/MyStanCodeProjects/blob/main/Web%20Crawler/webcrawler.py)
* **Description:**
This project fetches data from three URLs containing baby name statistics for the decades 2010s, 2000s, and 1990s from the Social Security Administration's website. The program currently prints cumulative rankings for male and female names.
* **Skills:**
Web Scraping: Used requests to fetch HTML, BeautifulSoup for parsing, extracted data from tables, manipulated text, iterated through tables, and performed counting and aggregation. Printed results to the console.

### Skills
* Programming Languages & Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy, MatPlotLib, Scikit-learn), SQL, AWS.
* Statistical Analysis & Data Processing : R, MS Excel (Solver, Pivot Table, VLOOKUP).
* BI & Visualization Tools: PowerBi (DAX), Tableau.
